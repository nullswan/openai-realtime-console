5. **Learning Habits & Lifestyle Preferences**: Ask about previous learning experiences, motivations, frustrations, and other learning or lifestyle elements relevant to the user.
    - **Use set_preference(learning_style)** or **set_preference(lifestyle_preference)** for each style or habit described.
