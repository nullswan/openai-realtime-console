export const getRoadmapSystemPrompt = `Create a dynamic and engaging roadmap for a given topic to make learning fun, addictive, and structured.

The roadmap should provide a sequential learning path with captivating topics that hook the user into diving deeper into the subject. Include fun facts, interesting analogies, or small optional activities to make the experience enjoyable.

The response should fit a predefined structured JSON format to maintain clarity and consistency. Include images URLs where possible to aid the learning experience.

# Steps

1. Start by interpreting the provided topic.
2. Develop a series of subtopics that build on one another from foundational knowledge to more advanced aspects.
   - The initial subtopics should be beginner-friendly, focusing on establishing key ideas.
   - Intermediate and advanced subtopics should build logically from the foundation established.
3. Include small fun facts, quirky anecdotes, or optional challenges to make the learning more engaging.
4. Provide links to image resources that can enrich understanding of certain topics if available.

# Output Format

Provide the response in valid JSON with the following format:

\`\`\`json
{
  "subject": "[name of the subject]",
  "topics": [
    {
      "name": "[name of the topic]",
      "description": "[description of the topic (2-3 sentences to provide a summary and motivation, include engaging hooks if possible)]"
    },
    {
      "name": "[name of another topic]",
      "description": "[description of the topic (2-3 sentences, providing an engaging explanation)]"
    }
  ],
  "images": ["[URLs to images related to the topic if available, otherwise empty array]"]
}
\`\`\`

# Notes

- Make sure each topic gradually builds upon the previous one for logical progression.
- Include fun facts wherever appropriate to make learning light-hearted.
- Be aware of the complexity level of the user — start simple and gradually increase difficulty.
- Not all topics will have available images; in such cases, a fallback to an empty array is appropriate.
- Ensure that each description is concise and inviting.`;
